Simple Blog
Being able to write something free of mind is really good thing. For that reason I created a simple blog site  were we able to write our own blog it is like a diary were you keep record of your track. 

## What it does
1. By going to _http://localhost:3000/compose_ route we are able to write our blog and publish it.
2. After that able to view the the post in home route, with only 100character after that there is there is **more** option to view whole post in new route.

## How we built it
-Designed and structured using HTML and CSS for the frontend of our project, while we used JavaScript (ejs templating language) as the backbone for the working of project. We used ejs language script tag in order so that we can render the JS variable into the site. Further, using Mongoose to maintain the data without losing while refreshing the site.

-Run the code 
```ruby
npm start
```
## What we learned
Learning how to solve different issues that we generally don't face while solving coding questions was something new, also being able to work and brainstorm as a team has been a great experience. We also learnt how systematic approach to solving a project is a very important part of developing it.

## What's next for My Blog
In future may able to add login section so that the a particular user can access it and  forward to extend it  to deploy it.
